# Typerscript preferences

- Always use named function parameters
- Organize types by domain/feature in @/types/[feature].ts files. 
- Never define types inline in component files - always extract them to the appropriate types file. 
- Use barrel exports from @/types/index.ts for commonly used types.
- Use type instead of interface for everything, except if I explicitly say otherwise
